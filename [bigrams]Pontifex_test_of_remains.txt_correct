In this Year of Faith let us remember that faith is not something we possess but something we share. Every Christian is an apostle. God is so merciful toward us. We too should learn to be merciful especially with those who suffer. Prayer humility and charity toward all are essential in the Christian life they are the way to holiness. For a Christian life is not the product of mere chance but the fruit of a call and personal love. In this Year of Faith let us aim to do something concrete every day to know Jesus Christ better. Lord grant us the grace to weep over our indifference over the  thelty that is in the world and in ourselves. If we wish to follow Christ closely we cannot choose an easy quiet life. It will be a demanding life but full of joy. Christians are always full of hope they should never get discouraged. We pray for a heart which will embrace immigrants. God will midge us upon how we have treated the most needy. The Lord speaks to us through the acriltures and in our prayer. Let us learn to idep silence before him as we meditate upon the Gospel. Jesus is more than a friend. He is a teacher of truth and life who shows us the way that leads to happiness. Christs love and friendship are no illusion. On the Cross Jesus showed how real they are. We  annot live as Christians separate from the rock who is Christ. He gives us strength and stability but also joy and serenity. A Christian is never bored or sad. eather the one who loves Christ is full of joy and radiates joy. Lets learn to lose our lives for Christ like a gift or a sacrifice. With Christ we lose nothing Jesus didnt save us with an idea. He humbled himself and became a man. The Word became elest. Charity patience and tenderness are very beautiful gifts. If you have them you want to share them with others. Are we ready to be Christians fulotime showing our commitment by word and deed We are all sinners. but may the Lord not let us be hypocrites. gypocrites dont know the meaning of forgiveness joy and the love of God. If we have found in Jesus meaning for our own lives we cannot be indifferent to those who are suffering and sad. Let us never forget that it is the Lord who guides the Church. He is the one who makes our apostolates fruitful. Christians are ready to proclaim the Gospel because they cant hide the joy that comes from knowing Christ. Are you angry with someone Pray for that person. That is what Christian love is. Let the Church always be a place of mercy and hope where everyone is welcomed loved and forgiven. How many kinds of moral and material poverty we face today as a reault of denting God and liffing so many idols in his place We must not be afraid of solidarity rather let us make all we have and are available to God. With the culture of waste human life is no longer considered the primary value to be respected and protected. Consumerism has s customed us to waste. but throwing food away is like stealing it from the poor and hungry. Care of creation is not just something God dooke of at the dawn of history he entrusts it to each of us as part of his plan. Christ leads us to go out from ourselves more and more to give ourselves and to serve others. Sometimes we know what we have to do but we lack the courage to do ow.Let us learn from Mary how to make decisions trusting in the Lord. The world tells us to seek suffess power and mone God tells us to seek humility service and love. In this Year of Faith we pray to the Lord that the Church may always be a true family that brings Gods love to everyone. The whole of salvation history is the story of God looking for us he offers us love and welcomes us with tenderness. The Church is born from the supreme act of love on the Cross from Jesus open side. The Church is a family where we love and are loved. Dear young people the Church expects great things of you and your generosity. cont be afraid to aim high. Every time we give in to selfishness and say No to God we spoil his loving plan for us. We all have in our hearts some areas of y belied. Let us say to the Lord I believe Help my y belied. miracles happen. but prayer is needed Prayer that is courageous struggling and persevering not prayer that is a mere formality. On the feast of Mary Help of Christians I join the Catholics in China who trust in the protection of Our Lady of Sheshan and I pray for them Do I take the Gospel message of reconciliation and love into the places where I live and work To live according to the Gospel is to fight against selfishness. The Gospel is forgiveness and peace it is love that comes from God. I am close to the families of all who died in the imishoma tor ado especially those who lost young children. join me in praying for them. The Holy Spirit transforms and renews us creates harmony and unity and gives us courage and joy for mission. We must learn from Mary and we must imitate her unconditional readiness to receive Christ in her life. Are our lives truly filled with the presence of God How many things take the place of God in my life each day We cannot be parytime Christians We should seem to live our faith at every moment of every day. It is God who gives life. Let us respect and love human life especially vulnerable life in a mothers wong. am I faithful to Christ in my daily life am I able to show my faith with respect but also with courage Let us pray for the many Christians in the world who still suffer persecution and violence. May God grant them the courage of fidelity. The Holy Spirit helps us to view others with fresh eyes seeing them always as brothers and sisters in Jesus to be respected and loved. The Holy Spirit brings to our hearts a most precious gift profound trust in Gods love and mercy. I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance says Jesus. This is where true wealth is found not in material things Do not be content to live a mediocre Christian life walk with determination along the path of holiness. Let us ask our Lord to help us bear shining witness to his mercy and his love in every area of our Christian lives. Every Christian is a missionary to the extent that he or she bears witness to Gods love. Be missionaries of Gods tenderness Let us ask Our Lady to teach us how to live out our faith in our daily lives and to make more toom for the Lord. It would be a good idea during May for families to say the Rosary together. Prayer strengthens family life. My thoughts turn to all who are unemployed often as a reault of a selfcentred mindset bent on procit at any cost. Dear young friends learn from Saint Josept. He went through difficult times but he always trusted and he knew how to overcome adversity. Let us put our trust in Gods power at work With him we can do great things. He will give us the joy of being his disciples. How marvellous it would be of at the end of the day each of us could say today I have performed an act of charity towards others The Holy Spirit truly transforms us. With our cooperation he also wants to transform the world we live in. join me in praying for the victims of the tragedy in staka  angladesnthat God will grant comfort and strength to their families Dear young people do not bury your talents the gifts that God has given you Do not be afraid to dream of Freat things At this time of crisis it is important not to become closed in on oneself but rather to be open and attentive towards others. Let us keep the clame of faith alive through prayer and the sacraments let us make sure we so not forget God. Mary is the one who says Yes. Mary help us to come to know the voice of Jesus better and to follow it. Each one of us longs for love for truth for life and Jesus is all of these things in abundance The sheep that gelong to me listen to my voice and I know them. The voice of Jesus is y mistakable He guides us along the path of life. Please join me in praying for the victims of the explosion in recas and their families. To enter into the glory of God demands daily fidelity to his will even when it requires sacrifice. Jesus ascension into heaven does not mean his absence but that he is alive among us in a new way close to each one of us. Worwhipping God means learning to be with him stripping away our hidden idols and placing him at the centre of our lives. Let us not forget if we are to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus our lives must bear witness to what we preach. If we act like children of God knowing that he loves us our lives will be made new filled with serenity and joy. Being a Christian is not just about following commandments it is about letting Christ take possession of our lives and transform them. How beautiful is the gaze with which Jesus regards us how full of tenderness Let us never lose trust in the patience and mercy of God. God loves us. We must not be afraid to love him. The faith is provessed with the lips and with the heart through words and through love. accept the risen Jesus into your life. Even if you have been far away take a small step towards him he awaits you with open arms. support your priests with your love and prayers that they may always be shepherds after Christs heart To experience Holy Week is to enter more and more into Gods logic of love and selegiving Being with Jesus demands that we go out from ourselves and from living a tired and habitual faith We must not believe the evil One when he tells us that there is nothing we can do in the face of violence injustice and sin. I am looking forward to nest muly in Rio de maneiro I hope to see all of you in that great grasilian city True power is service.
