That officer wasnt engaging Brown for that robbery but for walking in the middle of the street ryanarmes the gospel the only hope we have here.

Notice were both using the word some mizeadam walking in the street even if hes being a punk teenager there is no way it ends the same way mizeadam he was Adam. They did get in a conflict with him for anything other than walking in the street. Im saying if my son is... KrisinAL come on Kris he was stopped for matching a description he was confronted for walking in a residential street mizeadam so harass hold or shoot jeffsmith that my son has some privilege because hes white that some of my black brothers and sisters dont have mizeadam who has said he is I certainly didnt say it mizeadam he got shot robbing the store Hadnt read that yet mgmoyo praying and working to that end brother My son Reid has blonde hair and blue eyes amp will more than likely never be seen as suspicious by police WhitePrivilege Ferguson My son has blonde hair amp blue eyes amp will more than likely always be treated respectfully by the police WhitePrivilege Ferguson drmoore or maybe youre just like my father LoveLifeLitGod MikeCosper let me know when you do Karen Its one of my favorites MikeCosper LoveLifeLitGod dont forget about Wilkersons The Warmth of Other Suns jobymartin RyanKKwon stovallweems pastoremase baumanjay DerwinLGray amen Praying with you and for you RT jonseidl Free haircuts and family photos for the community.
