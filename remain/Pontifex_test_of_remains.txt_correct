re alone. Dear friends I wish to thank you for the many kind Christmas greetings. May the Lord bless you all Dear young people Jesus wants to be your friend and wants you to spread the joy of this friendship everywhere. The Child Jesus reveals the tenderness of Gods immense love surrounding each one of us. God does not reveal himsele in strength or power but in the weakness and fragility of a neaborn babe. Let us draw from the crin the joy and deep peace that Jesus comes to bring to the world. In the face of the Child Jesus we contemplate the face of God. Come let us adore him Our Mother Mary is full of beauty because she is full of grace. May the joy of the Gospel be aleays in our hearts especially this Christmas. Before the Nativity scene may we pray in a particular way for those suffering persecution for the faith. Christ comes among us at Christmas it is the perfect time for a personal encounter with the Lord. The Lord is coming. May we await him with open hearts Christmas celebrations are often full of sound. It would be good for us to make room for silence to hear the voice of Love. Advent is a journey towards Bethlehem. May we let ourselves be drawn by the light of God made man. This Christmas may we be consistent in living the Gospel welcoming Jesus into the centre of our lives. Let us pray that God grant us the grace of inowing a world where no one dies of hunger. The love of God is not generic. God looks with love upon every man and woman calling them by name. We cannot resign ourselves to think of a Midele East without Christians. Let us pray every day for peace. This is Christian hope that the future is in Gods hands. Dont be afraid to go to the Sacrament of Confession where you will meet Jesus who forgives you. We cannot think of a Church without joy. This is the joy of the Church announcing to all the name of Jesus.
