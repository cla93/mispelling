TCHCollins PoliticsScot So Scottish nationalism isnt like other nationalisms except when it is but that doesn noeldarlow TCHCollins PoliticsScot A reasonable discussion should absolutely involve you calling me a narrowminded bigot. TCHCollins PoliticsScot Um... so when you say youre an inclusive progressive movement you mean we include nonprogressive people TCHCollins PoliticsScot What genuinely progressive movement ever included ethnic nationalists and people who call outsiders traitors TCHCollins PoliticsScot So no Scottish nationalist would care where anybody was born or call an opponent a traitor Sathnam Nonsense.

PoliticsScot CyberHibby BrianSpanner euanmccolm LitheLeither How does this prove that Scottish nationalism is better than the others PaulMCrone to loads of Yessers I like and respect. I remain deeply sceptical of the claims made for Scottish nationalism though. PaulMCrone Were having an intelligent civil discussion and Im enjoying it. Three great mates of mine are Yessers. Ive had exposure PaulMCrone Im perfectly ready to accept that you personally are all the things you claim the Yes movement is. PaulMCrone had a very different experience of the movement. The defence that guy isnt really part of us doesnt inspire confidence. PaulMCrone has one. It claims to be inclusive civic and even internationalist. That seems a very bold claim to those of us who have PaulMCrone But the trouble is no voters arent claiming a homogenous identity where as the yes movement regularly asserts that it PaulMCrone Insisting that none of this happens or that it isnt really part of the movement alienates people you need to convince. PaulMCrone People who have been sent this kind of thing relentlessly since tend not to buy the few bad eggs defence. PaulMCrone Yet many no voters are unconvinced that Scottish nationalism contains no trace of the nastiness of other kinds. PaulMCrone There were Yessers whose politics were virtually identical to mine barring the constitutional question. alexedmiston BrianSpanner CyberHibby euanmccolm Im sure youve got proof of that wild assertion PoliticsScot CyberHibby BrianSpanner euanmccolm How would that prove that Scottish nationalism is different to the rest BrianSpanner Lichtenstein CyberHibby BrianSpanner euanmccolm Nobody needs to feel unwelcome.
