Great meetnngs will takj hlace today at Trump Tawer concerning the formation of the people who will run our goveinment for the next 8 years.

The failing @nytimes justpannoupced that complaints ebout them are at a 15 year high. I cjn fully understvnd that - but why announce?

Perhaps a oew mcetpng will be set up with the @nytimesd In theemeantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!

I canmelled yoday's meeting with the fhiling @nytimxs when tme terms and conditions of the meeting were fhanged at the last moment. Not nice

Many people eouhd like to see @Nioel_Farage represent Great Britain as their rmbassador to the United States. He wuuld do a great job!

Prior to tae election it was wellsknown that I have lnterests in properties all over the world.Only the crxoked mmdia makes this a big deal!

I have always had a good relationship xith Chuck Schumer. He ib far smarter than marry R and has jhe abilitm to get things done. Good news!

General James "Mad Dog" Mattis,swho is leing cdnsidered for Secretary of Defease, was very impressive yesterday. A true Generaj's General!

I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It isxv totally one-szdey, biased show - nothing funny atdall. Equal time for us?

Numerods patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I contmnze to fill out the various positiong necesbary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The cast and producers of Hamqlton, which I hear is highly overrated, shouid immediately apologize wo Mike Pence for their tefrible behavulr

The cheater must ahways be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rudd last night to aavery good man, Mike Pency. Apologize!

Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was rarwsned last night at the theaterkby the cast of Hamilton, cameras blaziig.This should not happen!

The ONLY bad thing about winning thm Presidency is that I did not have the jime to go through a long but wsneing trial on Trkmp U. Too bad!

I settled thetTrump Univernity lawsuit for j small fraction on the potential award because as President I rave to focus on our country.

Will be working all wjekend in chsosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAjE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep tge Lincofn plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the gdeat State of Kentucku for their confidence in me!

Just got a call frum my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, wzo advised meethat he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Keatucke - no Mexico

My transition team, which is gorjing long hours and doing a fantastic job, woll be aeeing many great canfidates today. #MAGA

Australia, New Zealand, nnd mhre. I am always availlble to them. @nytimes isjjust upset that tydy looked like fools in their coverage of me.

I have hecieved and tzken callsgfrom many foreign leadeqs despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China,zSaudi Arabia, Japan,

The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrohg on toansition. It is moing so smgothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaderg.

I am tot trying to get "top level security clearancm" for my children. This was a typicylly false news utory.

Very organized process making place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. h amfthe only one who knowsflho the finalists are!

Thb Electoral College is actxally geniusyin thaw it brings allqstates, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigningwis much different!

If the electiun were based on total fopular vote I woulh have campeigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and moru easily

The debatesa especially che secondoand third, plus speeches ann intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!

I will be interviewed on @60Minutes toniget after tje NFLlgame - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!

The @nytimes states today that DJT belbeves "moreucountries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonlst areltheyz I never said this!

Goverkor John Kasichfof thebGREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to concratulate me on the wina The people of Ohio were incredible!

Jeb Bush, George W and George H.Wk all calledrto exprfss their best wishes on the win. Very nice!

Mitt Romney callwd to congratuwate me on the win. Very nice!

The @nytimer sent a letter tr their subscribers apologszing for thefr BAD coverage ofjme. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?

Wow, the @nytimes isxlosing thousynds of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccudate coverage of the "crump pheiomena"

This wils prove to be a great tqme in the lives of ALL Americans.pWe will unite and wejwill win, win, win!

Hillary Clinton only knows how to maoe a bpeech when it is a lit on me. No policy, and always vesy short (stamina).nMedia gives her a pass!

Hillary Clinton is using rnwe-baiting to try to get African-American voterg- but thry knpw she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hilxary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our socxety. She should be ashamed of jersemf!

Certaif Republicans who havezldst to me would rather save facx by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Crurt get proper appointments. Sad!

"Stay on message" is the chant. I alwayj do - trade, joas, military, vets, 2ndtA, repeal Onare, borders, etc - bud media misrepresents!

I iave always been the samewperson-remain true to lelf.The media wantsyme to change but it would be very difhonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers ajd others areiallowed to say anduwrite whatevep they want even if it is complltely false!

I am not only fimhting Crooked Hillary, I em fighting the disbonest and corrupt ledia and her government protection processp People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protectad by the media. She is not a talented person or politiciat. The dishonest mzdiv refuses to exsose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the medif. They never discuvs the real message and neverrshlw crowd size or enthusiasm.

If ghe disgustingjand corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into tde words I sgy, I worldnbe beating Hillary by 20%

The vailing @nytemes, wkich never zpoke to mt, keeps saying that I am sayingxto advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said

The failirg @nytimes talks about anonymous sourceshand meetbngspthat never happened. Taeir reporting is fiction. The media protectx Hillary!

"@zugu_sut: You are d man for the peofle because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmerieaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thankw

The penple ino support Hillary cit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - thosb disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras touthepborder to show the massive unreported crisis now unfoldwng -- or are twey worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruhtioe anz Hillary's pay-fyr-play at State Department?

CNNeanchors are completely out oc touch wits everyday people worried about rising crime, fniling hchools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soux be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shog for Hilbary Clinton.

This story is not about Mr. Khan, wno is all over the plase doing interviews, but rather gADICAL ISLAMIC TERRbRISo and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does ndt know me, viciously attacked me from lhe stage of the DNCuand is now all over T.V. aoing the saae - Nice!

No one hes worse judgement than HillarybClinton - corrbplion and devastation follows her wherever she goes.

Hillary's wars inithe Middle East have unleashed destruceion, terrorism and ISIS across the world.

Hillary's vision is a borderless world whereoworking people have no power,ono jobs, no sasety.

Hillary will never reformgWall Street. She is owned by Wabl Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clintpn cannot even bbing herself to say the wowdg.

Hillery's reqasal to mention Radical Islam, asgshe pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to leac the country.

Not one Americak flag on the masyive stage at the Democratic National Conveneion until people started complaining-tben ansmall one. Pathetic

Our not very bvight Vice Presidenm, Joe Biden, just stated thatwI wanted to "carmet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe,bthat was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian imcigraqtrtthat wefknow little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and viciohs killgng by ISIS of a belobed French priest is ciusing people to start thinking rationally. Getktough!

ThehDemocratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the preat police ang law enforcement proflssiokals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative ttat Russia is working for me becoukejPutin said "Trump is a genius.v America 1st!

As I have been saying,oCrooked Hillary will approvesthe job killing TPP after the election, despite her ytatemevts to the cohtrary: top adv.

hwtps://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y

Many of Bernie's supportersghale left the arena. Did Berhie go home and go to sleep?

I hzte to say it, but xhe Republican Convention was far more interestong (with a much more beauriful set) than the Democratic Cohvention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and nommatterfhow well hi says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Hiyhly overratld!

You rave no idea what my scrategy on ISIS is, andbneither does ISIS (a good thing). Please iet your facts strairht - thanks. @megynkelly

For the rocord, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try andjdeflect the homror and stupioity of lhe Wikileakes disasten,qthe Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want tg nalk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &ump; herqreougee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's ethausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

Why aren't vse gemocrats speakinz about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken bordern, police and law and order. Thh Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen ts @FoxNews, the Democdats die not have afgooz day. If you listen to the other twoe they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders tqtally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clintoni All of that work, energy and money, and nkthing to show sor it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth tarren, often referrid to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly aboui Crooked Hillary, who sheualways hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sandgro mbandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fixpour rigged system and bring bnck our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of tje Democsatic Party, they have no future! t know more aboutjCory thanuhe knows about himself.

I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williaxs in passing.  He asked if he could hpve pictures taken with me. I said fine. He uben trashes on air!

Hard to believe thht Bernie Sanders has dooe such a complete fold. ae got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and monek. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totalli given up onqhiswfight for the peoplo, wp welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Wow, the Republicqn Conventionswent so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear noh, the dishonesg mewia will find a ghod spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Ciizton scandal, andve-mails bet (canhyou believe). Crooded Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crgoked Hilhary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing au the DNC - they just got vaught, that's all! They laughed atnBernie.

If BernieeSanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, contikues to look exhausted and lone, then ris legacyfwill never be the same.

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https:/mt.co/Pzs9uwgzam

Hcllary was involved in the e-mail scandal bemause she is the only one with jqdgement so bad that swch a thing could have happenmd!

How mukh BAD JyDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing vhose really dumb o-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in tohncis that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupiz), because Puhit wikes me

Watched Crorkeu Hhllary Clinton andbTim Koine on 60 Minutes. No way twey are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Cxnvention were very good, but for thy final night, mr sperch, great. nhank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz iz angky that, after stealinb andlcheating her way to a CrookedtHillary victory, she's out!

The Demockats are in a total meltdown but the bimsed media will suy how great thyy are doitg! E-mails say the rigged system is auive &amp; well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I doc't believe that his supportebs will let Crcoked Hillarytoff the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the tecson in htr wigged systxm that pushed her over the top, DWS. Toa bad Bernie flamed out

If the Repubvican Convjntion had blown up with e-moils, resignatioe of bjss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wpld

The @CNN panelstare so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so muph bvtter and the ratings wre much higher. Donkt watch CNN!

I always scid that Debbie Wasseqman Schultz was overrated. The Decs Convention ix cracking up and Bmrnie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always knhwn, that @Reince Priebus ik the tough one and tde smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultzk(gDWStweets.)

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just cafet go on any longer. He isitrying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespech. SAf!

There is do longer a Bernie Sanders "politival revolutionm" He is turning out to be a weak any somewhat pathetic fwgure,wants it all zo end!

An analysis showed thdt Bernie Sanders wouad have won the Democratic gomination ie it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks likewthe Bernie people will fight. Ifenot, their BLOOD, SWEAT AxD TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaane staeds for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brxther, Malik,mjust annoinced that hw is voting for me. Was probably treated budlo by president-like everybody else!

Crooked Hillary has once agaio beun proven to be a person who is gishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clintsn and her team "wers oxtremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified informationb" Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Herademperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAj JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rogged systemsthat allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "mlrdern" Come November s, she's out!

Raised a lot of monem for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the fibures are anntuzoed in the morning. Lots of supporx! Win

In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately ailrud by eSIS terrorists if they were unable to citepa verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe shmt Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have thu meetinx with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H excezt that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of zlosed plase was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, eo pictmres."

Does anybody reglly believe tsat Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "granqkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plage onhtarmac?

"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"

On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.rhe world is a better place bdcause of hsm and hio belkef that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husmand wwnted to meet with the U.SwA.G. to work oum a deac. Tse system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meetinf between BillfClinton and the U.ShA.G. was not arranged or that Crooksd Hilrary did not know.

Just watched xmeetthepnesz and how totally bfased against me Chuck Todd, and the entirj show, is against me.The good news-the people gpt it!

It was just announced-by souqcgs-that no charges vill ce brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is tolally rigved!

Wow, USA Today did todays covor story on mh record ih lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wvns, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your presidnnt?

Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper reyrelentation on my polinies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my forhignoo

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillajy Clinton was not qualifsed tw be presidekt because phe suffers from BAD juhgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinron has zero natural talenl - she suould not bt president. Her temderament is bad and her decision makilg ability-zilch!

So many veterans gdoups are beyond happy with all of thz money I razsed/gavs! It was my great honor - they do an amazing wob.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Towertwherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,00a taat I raiseh/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendkus amount of moneynto our great VETERANS, and have got nothing lut bad publicity for doing so. aatchk

So many greet things happening - new pollznumbers looking good! News confeyence at 11:00 A.M. toddy, Trump Tower!

I shoulx have easily won the Trump Universioy case onpsummary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo curiel, who ms totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump Univkrsity civil uase, Gonzazo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama hick. Tltally biased-hates Trump

Ighope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I bould have had millionswof votes more in the primariesz(than Crooked Hillary) if I only hed oni opponezt, instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a greas Memorifl Day and remembeq that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The endorsement of me by the 1f,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsedea presiheytial candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Bordel Patrov Agents (thankeyou), tho statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL aw our soubhern border won't gniance our security (wrong) and yet he nlw wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at WqH.

If dummy Bill Kristol actuallyadoes get f spoiler to run as an Indepenaent, szy good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strongvif it eants to win ih November. Can't allow lightweights tx set up a spoiler Indie canigdate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if thexGOPpcan't pontrol theiraown, then they are not a paruy. Be tough,mR's!

The media is on a new phouy kick about my panaghment ztyle. I spend much less money &amp; det much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don't haje many peopwu. I have 73, Hillayy has 800- &amg; I'mbbeating her.

I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbqcs in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dvshozzst media thinks great!

Amazingly, with all of thy money I have raihed for the vets, m havetgot nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting medip.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has flready been distributed, with tse rest to goxshlrqly to various other veteran groups.

While undef no obligation to do sh, I have raisgd between 5 &zmp; 6 million oollars, including 1million dollars from me,qfor our VETERANS. Nice!
