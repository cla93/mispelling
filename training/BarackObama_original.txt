President Obama IranDeal As Americans we should be proud of this achievement. President Obama IranDeal Now we have before us a solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon without resorting to war. President Obama IranDeal President Kennedy warned Americans not to see conflict as inevitable. It is time to apply such wisdom. President Obama IranDeal I have repeatedly challenged anyone opposed to this deal to put forward a better plausible alternative. President Obama IranDeal When we carefully examine the arguments against this deal none of them stand up to scrutiny. President Obama IranDeal If Iran violates this deal we will have ample opportunity to respond. President Obama IranDeal Worry less about being labeled weak. Worry more about getting it right. President Obama IranDeal How can we in good conscience justify war before we have tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives President Obama The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some sort of war. President Obama IranDeal Walk away from this agreement and you will get a better dealfor Iran. President Obama IranDeal Those who say we can walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. President Obama IranDeal We will continue to have sanctions in place on Irans support for terrorism and violation of human rights.President Obama IranDeal There is no scenario where sanctions relief turns Iran into the regions dominate power. President Obama IranDeal An argument against sanctions relief is effectively an argument against any diplomatic solution. President Obama IranDeal Without this deal the scenarios that critics warn about happening in years could happen six months from now. President Obama The bottom line is if Iran cheats we can catch themand we will. President Obama IranDeal This deal is not just the best choice among alternativesthis is the strongest nonproliferation agreement ever. President Obama If Iran violates the agreement over the next decade all of the sanctions can snap back in to place. President Obama IranDeal Iran has powerful incentives to keep its commitments. President Obama IranDeal This deal shuts off the type of covert program Iran has pursued in the past. President Obama IranDeal In July we reached a comprehensive plan of action that meets our objectives. President Obama IranDeal What was once proclaimed as a historic mistake is now held up as a success. President Obama IranDeal The progress of Irans nuclear program was halted for the first time in a decade. President Obama IranDeal It was diplomacy that ratcheted up the pressure on Iran. President Obama IranDeal Winning this global buyin was not easy. I know. I was there. President Obama IranDeal What made our new approach more effective was our ability to draw upon new U.N. Security Council resolutions. President Obama IranDeal It was our very willingness to negotiate that helped America rally the world to our cause. President Obama IranDeal I have also made clear my preference for a peaceful diplomatic resolution of the issue. President Obama IranDeal Even before taking office I made clear that Iran would not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon on my watch.
