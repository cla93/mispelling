JimmyVosika Actually didnt get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed. If speed at stage separation gt kmhr. With a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to kmh. Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site As mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude amp distance dont mean much for orbit. All about speed. mbhnyc steel collet Well at least the pieces were bigger this time Wont be last RUD but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. UncleGus probably However that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didnt latch so it tipped over after landing. Definitely harder to land on a ship.

That was bad CO for indiv this for the planet Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change Yeah climate change should really be considered a centrist issue as it affects everyone. Am not suggesting shutting down CO production but rather to price in environmental cost amp shift to sustainable energy Even if the answer is only on the order of we should still take immediate action as there is only one atmosphere. Right question to ask Dyson or others what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about any subject. That is not the point. knxviain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change but I really thought world wd take action sooner.

A CO tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling dynamic air suspension amp mega torque. Technically I got rich from Zip amp PayPal w zero govt anything then put of that into SpaceX Tesla amp SolarCity. If consumption is low then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods amp critical meds. ponder Carbon produced by a SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one flight. No we should not be exempt. Net of gas savings a Tesla is to month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems. Yes am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution. Trees are net consumers of CO so technically we would pay them money Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway. Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases ie consumption. Much better to emphasize the latter. MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually not always better than the smartest govt regulator. Me amp other private money funded Tesla for first years got IPO govt money for now paid back. Yes carbon tax would be a better way. grayj There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years just like we do a census. Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes dont ban a purchase they just increase cost. Am against bans except in extreme cases. Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide. Perhaps. I am in favor of fair simple taxes that are neutral on most things incent good amp disincent bad. Great article on Tesladealer battle by Leilani Munter CarbonFreeGirl who lives in NC VarunG Belief in climate change isnt necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax. karlbrauer Making rockets tonykatz Dont like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history. SapientCapital We created electric cars to help solve the problem not because we thought it was easy money. Still isnt.
