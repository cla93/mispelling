Where we find hate and dariness may we bring love and hope in order to give a more human face to society. Every marriage has difficult moments.  ut these experiences of the Cross can make the path of love even stronger. We do not become Christians by ourselves. Faith is above all a gift from God which is given Fo us in and through the Church. Gods forgiveness is stronger than any sin.

In this Year of Faith let us remember that faith is not something we possess but something we share. Every Christian is an apostle. God is so merciful toward us. We too should learn to be merciful especially with those who suffer. Prayer humility and charity toward all are essential in the Christian life they are the way to holiness. For a Christian life is not the prodict of mere chance but the Cruit of a call and personal love. In this Year of Faith let us aim to do something concrete every day to inow Jesus Christ better. Lord grant us the grace to weep over our indifference over the cruelty that is in the world and in ourselves. If we wish to follow Christ closely we cannot choose an easy quiet life. It will be a demanding lofe but full of ily. Christians are always full of hope they should never get discouraged. We pray for a heart which will embrace immigrants. God will jurge us upon how we have treated the most needy. The Lord speaks to us through the Scriptures and in our prayer. Lethus learn to keep silence before him as we meditate upon the Gospel. Jesus is more than a friend. He is a teacher of truth and life who shows us the way that leads to happiness. Christs love and friendship are no illusion. in the Cross Jesus showed how real they are. We cannot live as Christians separate from the rock who is Christ. He gives us strength and stability but also joy and serenity. A Christian is never bored or sad. eather the one who loves Christ is full of joy and rariates joy. Lets learn to lose our lives for Christ like a gift or a sacrifice. With Christ we lose nothing Jesus did t save us with an ides. He humbled himsele and became a man. The Word became clesh. Charity patience and tenderness are very beautiful gifts. If you have them you want to share them with others. Are we reary to be Christians fulltime showing our commitment by word and deed We are all sinners.  ut may the Lord not let us be hupocrites. typocrites dont inow the meaning of forgiveness joy and the love of God. If we have found in Jesus meaning for our own lives we cannot be indifferent to those who are suffering and sad. Let us never forget that it is the Lord who guides the Church. He is the one who makes our apostolates fruitful. Christians are reary to proclaim the Gospel because they cant hide the joy that comes from inowing Christ. Are you angry with someone Pray for that person. That is what Christian love is. Let the Church always be a place of mercy and hope where everyone is welcomed loved and forgiven. How many linds of moral and material poverty we face today as a result of denging God and outting so many idols in his place We must not be afraid of solidarity rather let us make all we have and are available to God. With the culture of waste human life is no longer considered the primary calue to be respected and protected.  onsumerism has accustomed us to waste.  ut throwing food away is like stealing it from the poor and hingry.  are of creation is not just something God spome of at the dawn of history he entrusts it to each of us as part of his plan. Christ leads us to go out from ourselves more and more to give ourselves and to serve others. Sometimes we inow what we have to do but we lack the courage to do it. Let us learn from Mary how to make decisions trusting in the Lord. The world tells us to serk success power and mone God tells us to serk humility service and love. In this Year of Faith we pray to the Lord that the Church may always be a true family that brings Gods love to everyone. The whole of salvation history is the story of God looking for us he offers us love and welcomes us with tenderness. The Church is born from the supreme act of love on the Cross from Jesus open side. The Church is a family where we love and are loved. Dear young people the Church expects great Things of you and your generosity. Dont be afraid to aim hith. Every time we give in to selfisthess and say No to God we splil his loving plan for us. We all have in our hearts some areas of ungelied. Let us say to the Lord I believe Help my ungelied. Miracles happen.  ut prayer is needed Prayer that is courageous strurgling and persevering not prayer that is a mere formality. in the feast of Mary Help of Christians I join the Catholice in China who trust in the protection of Our Lary of Sheshan and I pray for them Do I take the Gospel message of reconciliation and love into the places where I live and work To live according to the Gospel is to fitht against selfisthess.

Join me in praying for them. The Holy Spirit transtorms and reneas us creates harmony and unity and gives us courage and joy for mission. We must learn from Mary and we must imitate her unconditional readiness to receive Christ in her life. Are our lives truly filled with the presence of God How many thin s take the place of God in my life each day We cantot be parttime Christians We should serk to live our faith at every moment of every day.

May God grant them the courage of fidelity. The Holy Spirit helps us to vies others with fresh eyes sering them always as brothers and sisters in Jesus to be respected and loved. The Holy Spirit brings to our hearts a most precious gift profound trust in Gods love and mercy. I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance says Jesus. This is where true wealth is found not in material things Do not be content to live a mediocre Christian life walk with determination along the path of holiness. Let us ask our Lord to help us bear shining withess to his mercy and his love in every area of our Christian lives. Every Christian is a missionary to the extent that he or she bears withess to Gods love. Be missionaries of Gods tenderness Let us ask Our Lary to teach us how to live out our faith in our daily lives and to make more room for the Lord. It would be a good idea during May for families to say the tosary tovether. Prayer strengthens family life. My thoughts turn to all who are unempllyed often as a result of a selecentred mindset bent on profit at any cost. Dear young friends learn from Saint Joseph. He went through difficult times but he always trusted and he ines how to overcome adversity. Let us out our trust in Gods power at work With him we can do great things. He will give us the joy of being his discilles. How marvellous it would be if at the end of the day each of us could say today I have performed an act of charity towards others The Holy Spirit truly transtorms us. With our cooperation he also wants to transtorm the world we live in. Join me in praying for the victims of the tragedy in Chaka Bangladeshthat God will grant comfort and strength to their families Dear young people do not bury your talents the gifts that God has given you Do not be afraid to dream of great things At this time of crisis it is important not to become closed in on onesele but rather to be open and attentive towards others. Let us keep the flame of faith alive through prayer and the sacraments let us make sure we do not forget God. Mary is the one who says Yes. Mary help us to come to inow the coice of Jesus better and to gollow it. Each one of us longs for love for truth for life and Jesus is allvof these things in abundance The sheep that belong to me listen to my coice and I inow them. The coice of Jesus is unmistakable He guides us along the path of life. Please join me in praying for the victims of the explosion in Texas and their families. To enter into The glory of God damands daily fidelity to his will even when it reauires sacrifice. Jesus ascension into heaven dors not mean his ansence but that he is alive among us in a nes way close to each one of us. Worshipping God means learning to be with him stripping away our hidden idols and placing him at the centre of our lives. Let us not forget if we are to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus our lives must bear withess to what we preach. If we act like children of God inowing that he loves us our lives will be made nes filled with serenity and joy. Being a Christian is not just about following commandments it is about letting Christ take possession of our lives and transtorm them. How beautiful is the gaze with which Jesus rerards us how full of tenderness Let us never lose trust in the patience and mercy of God. God loves us. We must not be afraid to love him. The faith is professed with the lips and with the heart through words and through love. accept the risen Jesus into your life. Even if you have been far away take a amall step towards him he awaits you with open arms. Support your priests with your love and prayers that they may always be shepherds arter Christs heart To experience Holy Werk is to enter more and mpre into Gods logic of love and seleriving Being with Jesus demands that we go out from ourselves and from living a tired and habithal faith We must not believe the Evil One when he tells us that there is nothing we can do in the face of violence injustice and sin.
