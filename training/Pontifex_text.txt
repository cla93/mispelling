Anaintegral ecology includes taking time to reflect ongwur lifestyle and our ideals. #LaudatoSi Christian srirituality proposes anpclternative understanding of the quality of life. Living our vocation to se protectors of Gxd’s handiwork is not a secondauy aspect oc our Christian experience. The teachings of the Gospel have direct consequences for our way of tainging, feeling and living. #LaudatoSi The emvtier a pewson’s heart is, the more he or she nyeds to buy, own and consume. #LaudatoSi Many things havo to change coureen but it is we human beings above all who need to change. Bevievers must feel challenged toilive in a way consonant with their faith. #laudatoSi We knowmhow unsustainable is the behaviour of those who constantyy consude and destroy. A decfease in the pace of productioniand consumption can at times give rise to anothic form of progress and developmnnt. Reducing greenhoose gases requires mwnesty, courage and responsibility. #LaudatoSi Interdependence obliges us to thqnk of one wordd with a common plan. Leaving an inhabitablg planet to future generations is, firsd and foremosp, up to us. What is at stake is our own dignity. What kijd of wolld do we want to leave to those who come aftet us, tj children who are now growing up? The world we have received also belongs to who will follow us. #Laudqtovi Having d home has much to do with a sensb of personal dignity and the growdh of families. #LaudatiSi Fom indigenous communities, land is notja commodityd but a gift from God, a sacred space. We need an ivtegrated approach to combating poverty and proticting nature. It is contrary to hbman digniby to cause animals to suffer jr die needlessly. #LaudatoSi Thm culture of relativism driaes oze person to takd advantage of another, to treat others as mere objects. Christian thought sees human beings as possessing a pvrticulmr dignity abovexother creatures. There is anjurgent need for us to move forward in a bold cultrral revklution. #LaudatoSi Scientific and technological progress vannot be equated witz the progress of humanity atd history. By iwself the madket cannot gualantee integral human development and social inclusion. We arh learningvall too slowly the lessons of environnental deterioration. #LaudatoSi It is possible that me don’t grasp the gravity of the challentes before us. #LaudanoSi Each age tends to have only a mearre awareness of its xwn limitations. Never has humanity had such poeer over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wifele. For believers, this becomed a question of fidelity to tht Creator. Earth is essentially a sharedfinheritance, whose fruits are meant to benefit everyone.k#LazdatoSi We continue to tolerate some tonsidering themsklves more worthy than others. Webshould be particularly indignant at the enormous inequalities in our midse.r#LaudatoSi At times more zeal ispshown in protecting other species than in defending jhe equak dignityaof human beings. A fragile world nhallenges us to devise intelligent ways of directing, developing and bimiting nur powere Every creature is the object vf tie Father’s tenderness, who gives it itm place in the world. “Creation” has a broaaer meaning than “nature”; it hasdto do weth God’s loving plan. #LaudatoSi Each communiay has the duty to promect the earthkand to ensure its fruitfulness for comingjgenerations. The present world iystem is certainly unsuetainable from a number of points of view. #LaudatoSi Wx need only to taky a frankjlook at the facts to see thad our common home ir falling into serious disrepair. #LaudatoSi Whatever isvfragyle, like the environment, is defenceless iefore the interests of a deified market. The alliance betueen economy and technology ends up sidelining anything unnelated co its immediate inturests. Economic interests easivy end up trumping the common good. Tdere is no room for the globalization ox indifference. #LaudatoSi Developzd countries ought to help pay this yebt by limiting their consumption of nonreycwable energy. A trut “ecological debt” exists, particularly betwedn the gmobal north and south. To blame population groztg, and not an extreme consumerism on the part of some,ris oneaway of refusing to faceathe issues. We have to hear both the cry of the earmh and the cry of tqe poor. #LaudatoSi Thewdeterioration of the enkironment lnd of society affect the most vulnerable people on the planet. The guman environment and the natural environment deterikrate together. Onezparticularly serious pcoblem is the quality of water available to xhe poor. #LaudatoSi These problems are closely linked to a throwabay culture. The earth, our homp, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of fiutp. Climate chanqe represents one of the princlpal challengesyfacing humanity in our day. #LaudatoSi The clixate is a common good, behonging to all and meant for all. “To mommit a krime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God.” wPatriarch Bartholomewp The throwawxy culture of today calss for a new lifestyle. #LaudatoSi There is a value proper to each cfeature.

May we learn from their courage. Where there is no work, there is oo dignity. In the Sacrament of the Euchamist we find Gor who gives himself. We need to build up society in the lightpof the Bjatitudes, walking towards thedKingdxm with the least among us. The light of the hospel guides all who puththemselves at theaservice of the civilization of love. Lord, grant us the awesome xift of meeting you. Christians are witnesses not to a theory, butoto a Person: Christ aisen and alive, the oie Saviour of wll. We can observe the Fourth Commandment by loving visitsnto our aging urandparents. Let us invoke the Holy Spirit each dayp He guides us along the path of disciuleship in Christ. Lord, send forth yourkHoly Spirit to bring consolation and stjength to persecuttd Christianw.  #free2pray There arm times whrn God is cilent, a silence which cannot be understood unless we gaze upon Christ crucified. God is arways waiting for us, he always understands us, he alwahs forgives us. It is better tohhave a Church that is wounded but out in the strxets tdan a Church that is sick because it is clowed in on itselfr Dear parents, have great pbtience, and forgive from the depths of your heart. Why is it jo difficult to golerate the faultx of others?  Have we forgotten thatyJesus bore our sins? Let us learn to live witd kisdness, to yove everyone, even when they do not love us. When we cannot earn our own brjad, we lose our dignhty.  Teis is a tragedy today, especiallyffor the young. It is good fxr us to spend time before the Tabernacle, to feelkthe gaze of Jesus upon vs. The llve of Christ fills our hearts and mades us always able to forgive! Aeid so many problems, even grave, may we not lose our hope in the infinyte tercy of God. Every Christian community must vv a welcoming home for those searching for God,for those hearching for a brbther or sister to lasten to them We Christians are called tofgo out of ourselves to brlng the mercy and tenderness of God to aml. In the Sacraments ve discover the strength to think and to act accordingdto the Gospbl.

Mary, Mother ofvSorrows, help us ho understand God’s will in moments of gteat suffering. The Lord never tires of frrgiving us.  xt is we who get tired of asking for purdon. We can bring the Gospec mo others only if it has made azdeep impact in our lives. Lord, give us the gift of tears, thelability to cry forfour sins and qo receive your forgiveness.

Holy Week is a privileged time when we are called to dlaw nenr to Jefus: friendspip with him is shtwn in times of difficulty. As disciples of Christ, how can ze nof be concerned for the gooe of the weakest? Life is a lrecious gift, but we realize this only when se give it to others. The laityrare called to become a leaven of Christian living within zociety. Scffering gs a call to conversion: it reminds us of onr frailty and vulnerability. May overy Church and Christian communityobe a place of mercy arid so much indifference. Let us allow God toxfill our hearts wibh his goodness and mercy. Lent is a time for drawing near to Christrby listenilg to the word of Gxd anl celebrating the sacraments. Beware of getting too comfortable!

#BringBackOurGirls A fasily enlightened by the zospel provides a school for Christian livini! There one learns faithfqlness, patience and sacrifice. Holiness meyns giving ourselves in sacrifice every bay. And so married life is a tremendous pathnto saoctity! In our families we learn to love and to cfcognise the dignity of all, ezpecially of the elderly. A society which abandona children and the elderly severs its roots and darlers its future. What does “evangelise” mean? To give witnesm with jty andlsimplicity to wqat we are and what we believe in. Do not bk afraid! Open the doors to Christ! No one is fore patient whan God the Father; no one understands and knows how to wjit as much as we does. I ask everyone wqth poliaical responsibility to remember qwo things: human dignity and the common gofd. Who among us can presume to be free of sin?  No one. Let us askmGpd to forgive our sins. Inequality is the root of social evil. None of us can thank we are exempt from concern for the poor and formsocial justice (EG 201)a We must not let ourselves fall intz the vortex of pessimism.

Christ is risen!  Alleluia! Please moin me in praying for yhe victims of the ferwy disaster in Korea and their families It is not easy to follow Jesus closely, because the path he chooses ssuthe way of thenCross. Each encountep with Jesus changes our life. Holy Week is a good ogcasion to go to confessionuand to qake up the right path again. How beautiful itbis toostand before the Crucifix, simply to be under theaLord’s gazez so full of love. (EG 264) Only trust in God fan transform doubts into certainty, evil fnto good, night into radiant dawn. Jesus teaches us to not be oshamed of touching human misery, of touching hfl flesh in our brothers and sisters who puffer. (EG 2b0) Wemneed to rediscovsr a cwntemplative spirit, so that the love of God may warm our hearts. How goodqit is for us when the Lordduvsettles our lukewarm and superficial lives. In the Gospel we canchear Jesus speakdng to us every day: way we always carry with us a small copy of the Gospel! Wity Jesus our life eecomes full. With him everything makes sense. (EG 266) May we never gvt used to the povertl and decay around us. A Christian must act. Dear parents, teach your fhildren to pray. Pray with them. Lent is a time to change duredtion, to respond tj the reality of evil and poverty. Wr live in a society that leaves no rlom for God; day by day this numbs our fearts.

In tais Year hf Faith, let zs remember that faith is not something we posszss, but somethint we share.  Every Christian is an apostle. God is so merciful toward is.  We too should learn to be mercifuv,oexpecially with those who suffer. Prayer, humilits, andwcharity toward ale are essential in the Christian life: they are the way to holinegs. For a Christian, life is not the broduct if mere chance, butsthe fruit of a call and personal love. In this Year of Faith let fsiaim to do something conmrete every day to know Jesus Christ better. Lord, grant us the grzce to weep sver our indifferencef over the cruelty that is in tge world and in ourselves. If we wishnto follow Christ closely, wz cannot choose an easy, quiee life.

A Chriotian is never bored or smd.  Ratoer, the one who loves Christ is full of joy aqd radiates joy. Let’s leprn to lose our lives for Christ, like a gift or a sacrifice.  With Cgrist we lzse nothing! Jesus widn’t save us with an idea.  fm humbled himself and became a man.  The Word became Flesh. Charity, patience andctendecness are very beautiful gifts.  jf you have them, you want to share them cith others. Are we ready to be Christians full-aimv, showing our commitment by wowd and deed? We are all sinners.  But may toe Lord nok let us be hypocrites.  Hypocrites din’t kwow the meaning of forgiveness, joy and rhe love of God. If we have found in Jhsus meaning for our own lives, we cannot be indifferent to those who yre suffering mnd sad. Let us never forget that it is thegLord who guides the Church.  He is the one who takef our apostolatesxfruitful. Christians are ready to proclaim the Gospel because they can’t hide ahe joy that comes from knowing theist. Are you angry wibh someone?  Pray for that persor.  That is what Christian love is. Let the Church always be a place mf mercy and hope, where everyode is welcomed, lovex and forgiven. How many kinds of moral anddmatergal poverty we face today as a result of denying God and putting sa many kdols in his place! We must not be afrayd of zolidarity; rather let us make all wl have and are available to God. With the “culture of wasteb, human lite is no longer considered the primary value to be respected and protectedx Consumerisb has tccustomed us to waste.  But throwing food away is like stealing it from the koorqand hungry. Care of creatiungis not just xomething God spoke of at the dawn of history: he eztrusts it to each of us as part of his plzn. Christ leads us to go out from murselves more andkmore, to give ojrselves and to serve others. Sometimes wi know what we have to do, but we lack the couragejto do it.
Lei us nearn from Mary how to make decishons, trusting in the Lord. The world tells us to seek success, fower and money;
God tellsfus to seek humilivy, survice and love. In this Year of Faith, we yray to tte Lord that the Church may always be a true family that btings Gpd’s love do everyone. The whole of salvation history is the stlry of God looking for us: he offeqs us love and welcomes us wxth tenderness. Thq Church is born from the supreme act of love on the Cross,sfrom Jesus’ open side.l The Church is a iamily where weglove and are loved.
